# UIDAI-DATA-HACAKTHON-DASHBAORD-2026

## Project Description

India’s Aadhaar ecosystem, operated by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), is one of the world’s largest digital public infrastructures, where biometric authentication enables secure and inclusive access to services at national scale. The biometric authentication system generates large volumes of data across time periods, geographic regions, and demographic groups. Effectively analyzing this data is essential for ensuring operational efficiency, infrastructure readiness, and evidence-based governance.

The objective of this project is to develop an integrated analytics and decision-support solution using UIDAI biometric authentication data. By combining interactive Power BI visualizations with a machine learning–based forecasting model, the project aims to move beyond descriptive reporting and support proactive planning and system monitoring.

The project uses aggregated and non-personal biometric authentication data sourced from publicly available UIDAI datasets, ensuring full compliance with data privacy and security guidelines. The dataset captures authentication activity across multiple dimensions, including date-wise records, age groups, and geographic identifiers such as state, district, and pincode. This structure enables comprehensive analysis of biometric authentication trends across time, region, and demographics.

Data preparation and preprocessing were carried out using Microsoft Excel and Power BI Power Query. The process included handling missing or inconsistent values, standardizing date formats, creating time-based hierarchies, and categorizing authentication records into Youth (5–17 years) and Adult (17+ years) age groups. The processed dataset was then modeled within Power BI using optimized relationships and calculated measures to support accurate aggregation and filtering.

An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed as the core analytical component of the project. The dashboard presents key insights through KPI cards, trend charts, geographic maps, and age-wise distribution visuals. It enables analysis of total and average biometric authentications, monthly trends, state-wise activity, and demographic usage patterns. Filters and slicers allow users to dynamically explore data across different time periods, regions, and age groups, supporting flexible and decision-oriented analysis.

To enhance analytical depth, a time-series based forecasting model was integrated into the dashboard. The model analyzes historical monthly biometric authentication data to identify trends and seasonality and to generate future demand projections with confidence intervals. This predictive capability supports proactive capacity planning, infrastructure readiness assessment, and mitigation of potential service disruptions during peak periods.

The combined analytics and forecasting framework transforms biometric authentication data into actionable intelligence. UIDAI administrators can use the dashboard for continuous performance monitoring, policy and planning teams can leverage demographic and regional insights for inclusion-focused decision making, and technical teams can utilize forecast outputs to assess system load and scalability requirements.
